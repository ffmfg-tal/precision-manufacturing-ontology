## State of the Ontology

The ontology's strength is narrative and compositional: every archetype walks end-to-end, every extension carries a coherent entity model in prose, and the four-layer architecture cleanly separates standards from manufacturer-layer gap fills. Its weakness is mechanical: almost nothing has been translated from prose into machine-readable schema, lifecycle entities have not been given state graphs, and a handful of taxonomic questions have been deferred across documents rather than resolved anywhere.

**Phase 3.4 update (2026-04-23).** Phase 3.4 completed assembly-domain schema authoring: `schemas/assembly.yaml` (torque_specification, torque_sequence, torque_readings_record, witness_inspection, kit_record) and `schemas/inspection.yaml` (inspection_event, calibration_record, tool_gauge, key_characteristic). Three entities resolved as aliases/covered: fai_package → certification_package; quality_engineer → user.role; process_identification → material_identification callout_type. Schema defined now at 73 ✅ / 9 🔴. State machine added for tool_gauge (10 transitions, Current/Due_Soon/Overdue/Quarantined/Retired); calibration_record lifecycle corrected to ⬜ (immutable record; lifecycle on tool_gauge). Phase 3.3 (2026-04-22) completed state machine enumeration for material_lot, first_article_inspection, nonconformance_report, outside_process_operation, purchase_order, customer_purchase_order.

**Phase 2 update (2026-04-24).** Added Domains 9–12 (Process Engineering/NRE, Tool Room, Packaging, Change Management) plus Assembly Hardware and Operator Qualification cross-domain extensions. Entity count increases from 82 to 117. Five Phase 3.4 schema fixes applied: kit_record, torque_readings_record, torque_sequence, torque_specification, witness_inspection now correctly reference schemas/assembly.yaml; calibration_record, inspection_event, key_characteristic, tool_gauge now correctly reference schemas/inspection.yaml. Four new composition archetype walks added (Walks 4–7: calibration recall, ECN mid-production, fixture lifecycle, concurrent revision production).

**InspectAI update (2026-04-24).** Reviewed InspectAI (Lino's quality/FAI app, React 19 + CF Pages + Hono + D1) against the ontology. Six new entities derived: `characteristic` (all drawing callouts, not just KCs; maps InspectAI's AI-extraction pipeline), `measurement_result` (per-reading dimensional result — resolves a critical naming conflict: `pmi_event` is XRF/OES chemistry only, not dimensional measurements), `fmea_item` (AIAG PFMEA rows), `control_plan_item` (AIAG APQP control plan rows), `spc_result` (Cp/Cpk cached statistics), `ppap_submission` (AIAG PPAP 4th Edition 18-element submission). Three existing schemas updated: `inspection_event` gained `setup_number` attribute and `produces_measurement_results` relationship (pmi_events description corrected); `key_characteristic` gained `characteristic_id` FK; `first_article_inspection` gained `ppap_level` and `ppap_submission_id`; `inspection_plan` gained `fmea_document_id` and `control_plan_document_id`. Entity count increases to 117.

**Weakest columns.** Cross-ref integrity remains the weakest column: most Phase 2–4 entities have not been added to the UUID entity table in `extensions/uuid-discipline.md`. State machine has 2 remaining 🔴: quality_flowdown_plan (schema present, status field addition needed before graph can be written) and one other. Relationships typed is now all-green on schema-defined entities; the 🟡 cluster is aliases and display nodes.

**Reddest clusters.** The assembly-domain and inspection-domain red clusters are fully resolved (schemas/assembly.yaml and schemas/inspection.yaml authored in Phase 3.4). Phase 2 added 29 entities across Domains 9–12 and cross-domain extensions; all 29 enter the matrix with ✅ Schema defined — no new reds introduced by Phase 2. Remaining reds concentrate in: (1) external standards not authored here (machine_event, qif_results_document, x12_856_asn) — always 🔴/⬜ for schema; (2) string/enum decisions per 1.7 (country, heat_number, spec_body, uns_number, usml_category); (3) cross-ref integrity for all entities not yet added to UUID table; (4) quality_flowdown_plan state machine (attribute gap blocks graph authoring).

**Cross-cutting patterns.** Three patterns recur: (a) **taxonomic open questions** deferred to "the matrix task to resolve" — `assembly` vs recursive `part`, `fastener` scope, `quality_engineer` vs role, `heat_number` / `uns_number` / `country` / `spec_body` / `nadcap_category` as entities vs strings, cert package nesting, `supplier` / `vendor` / `approved_vendor_list_entry` aliasing. The matrix surfaces these in their row notes but does not resolve them; resolution belongs to the deepening pass. (b) **Lifecycle entities without state machines** — jobs, operations, POs, shipments, FAIs, NCRs, and material lots have enum status fields but no documented transition rules, guards, or terminal-state definitions. (c) **Carbon framing residue is minor** — only `material` shows direct vocabulary borrowing (the layered-disclosure approach and substance/form decomposition trace to Barbin's schema per `carbon-os-mapping.md`). Most entities are defined on their own terms.

**Top 5 priorities for the deepening pass:**
1. **Schema authoring** — largely complete as of Phase 2 + InspectAI (106 of 117 entities have schemas). Remaining 11 null-schema entries are intentional: external standards (machine_event, qif_results_document, x12_856_asn), string/enum decisions (country, heat_number, spec_body, uns_number, usml_category), removed-from-canon (item), and no-schema coverage by alias/parent (fai_form_1_header, fai_package, quality_engineer, supplier_approval, process_identification, export_compliance_declaration). A future deepening pass may promote fai_form_1_header and fai_package to standalone schemas.
2. **State-machine enumeration** for the 14 lifecycle-bearing entities, with explicit transitions, guards, and terminal states.
3. **Resolve the nine taxonomic open questions** (assembly vs part, fastener scope, supplier/vendor alias, PO hierarchy, shipment direction, cert-document supertype, string-vs-entity decisions for heat/UNS/country, quality_engineer as role, cert-package nesting).
4. **Define the seven "referenced but undefined" entities** (`customer`, `sales_order`, `part_specification`, `user`, `inventory_location`, `bom_line`, `item`) — each currently appears as a uuid-ref target with no schema or prose definition.
5. **De-Carbonize `material.yaml`** — the layered-disclosure approach is sound, but the alloy_family enum and form enum should be audited for Carbon borrowings and re-grounded against AMS commodity groups and aerospace-specific forms.

**Observations from tally (Phase 3.4):**
- **Schema defined** now at 106 ✅ / 11 🔴. Phase 3.4 added `schemas/assembly.yaml` (torque_specification, torque_sequence, torque_readings_record, witness_inspection, kit_record) and `schemas/inspection.yaml` (inspection_event, calibration_record, tool_gauge, key_characteristic). Phase 2 added schemas for all 29 new entities (Domains 9–12, Assembly Hardware, Operator Qualification). InspectAI added 6 new schemas (characteristic.yaml, measurement_result.yaml, quality_tools.yaml). Remaining 11 🔴: external standards (machine_event, qif_results_document, x12_856_asn), string/enum per Decision 1.7 (country, heat_number, spec_body, uns_number, usml_category), removed-from-canon (item), and no-schema aliases/embedded sub-objects with no independent schema (fai_form_1_header, fai_package, quality_engineer, supplier_approval, process_identification, export_compliance_declaration) — but these are ⬜-equivalent where the schema is provided by the parent entity or alias target. The 🔴 count above reflects entities with `has_schema: null` and no alias resolution.
- **State machine** at Phase 3.4: 12 ✅ / 2 🟡 / 2 🔴 / 66 ⬜. Phase 3.4 added tool_gauge transition graph (Current/Due_Soon/Overdue/Quarantined/Retired; 10 transitions); calibration_record corrected from 🔴 to ⬜ (lifecycle on tool_gauge, not the record). Remaining 🔴: `quality_flowdown_plan` (schema present, status field needs addition before graph), and one other unresolved entity. 🟡: `shipment` (two-direction, partial), `work_order` (partial).
- **Attributes complete** at 58 ✅ / 21 🟡 / 3 🔴. Assembly-domain red cluster fully resolved. Remaining 3 🔴 are confined to external/non-schema entities.
- **Relationships typed** reached 44 ✅ / 36 🟡 / 0 🔴. All schema-defined entities now have typed cardinality; the 🟡 cluster is alias/display nodes without fully enumerated cardinality (fai_package, quality_engineer) and entities with partial cardinality annotations.
- **Composition rule** at 64 ✅ / 11 🟡 / 1 🔴. Assembly-domain open questions resolved (work_center/tool_gauge separation, torque_spec/torque_seq/torque_readings_record separation, kit_contents flat JSONB). Remaining 🔴 is the one non-schema external entity.
- **Canonical framing** remains 79 ✅. No change.
- **Cross-ref integrity**: the UUID table in `extensions/uuid-discipline.md` remains the main gap — Phase 2–3 entities not yet added to the UUID entity table. Phase 3.5 work item.
- **Standards provenance**: 39 ✅ / 32 🟡 / 3 🔴 / 8 ⬜. Phase 3.4 promoted key_characteristic (AS9100/AS9102/QIF all mapped), kit_record to ⬜ (Layer-2 pure), and moved four torque/assembly entities from 🔴 to 🟡 (AS5272/NASM 33540 referenced via FK but not fully cross-referenced in standards/). Remaining 🔴: three entities with no applicable standard (pure Layer-2).
